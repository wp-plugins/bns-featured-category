== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =

Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

= How can I style the plugin output? =

The plugin uses several "common" WordPress functions that create standard class and id elements that can be styled in the style.css file
* the classes generated by the post_class() function; and, the id generated by "post-" apended to the_ID() function wrap the general post output
* the plugin class `post-details` wraps the general meta details of the post, such as the Author, Categories, Tags, etc.
* the overall plugin may also be wrapped in a widget "container" class, or id, specific to the theme itself such as (but not limited to): widget, sidebar, left, right, etc.

With the addition of the display Category Description option an additional class was written into the plugin. To style the category description displayed add the class 'bnsfc-cat-desc' to your style.css file then use your choice of properties to style the text, for example:
`
.bnsfc-cat-desc {font-style: italic;}
`

= Can I increase the maximum posts to display? =

The maximum posts displayed by the widget is controlled by the "posts per page" setting as set under Settings | Reading.
If you wish to increase the total posts displayed by the widget you can increase this number but it will also increase the number of posts displayed by the Loop routine(s). NB: This is still under review for future updates.
